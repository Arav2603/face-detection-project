# face-detection-project
Description:
The real-time face detection project utilizes OpenCV, a computer vision library, to detect and locate human faces in a live video stream captured from a webcam. Using a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier, the application identifies facial features by analyzing patterns within the grayscale image. Upon detecting a face, the system outlines the detected face with rectangles in the video feed. This project focuses on leveraging computer vision techniques to identify and highlight human faces within a live video environment in real-time.

Key Features:

Utilizes OpenCV for computer vision tasks.
Accesses the webcam feed to capture real-time video.
Applies a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for face detection.
Draws rectangles around detected faces in the video stream.

Purpose:
The project serves as an introduction to computer vision applications using OpenCV, demonstrating the capability to detect and locate human faces within a video feed. It showcases the fundamental use of Haar cascade classifiers for object detection and highlights the real-time capabilities of computer vision algorithms in identifying and marking specific features within a live video stream.
